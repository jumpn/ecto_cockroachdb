# Deprecated / No longer needed !

This fork is no longer necessary given CockroackDB 20.1+ supports timestamp with optional precision.
You can now use the Postgresql Adaptor bundled with `ecto_sql`, the only special things you need to do is to disable migration locking in your repo config with:
`migration_lock: nil`



# CockroachDB Ecto Adaptor

This is a very small fork of the official Postgresql Adaptor bundled with `ecto_sql`.

The main reason for this fork is Ecto 3.x no longer keeps microseconds information for `:time`, `:naive_datetime` and `:utc_datetime`.

The net effect is it uses timestamp(0) when creating fields with such types and the migration table used by Ecto is using one of those types.

The problem is CockroachDB does not support timestamp with precision unless it's the default precision (6).

This adaptor use the default precision for those types.
It also disable the migration lock given locking is not supported by CockroachDB either.
